The vision and mission of the centre finds a stronghold of the foundation of IIT(ISM) Dhanbad. With nearly 100 years of long history of making remarkable contribution to the industries associated with Earth resources and energy, IIT(ISM) Dhanbad is recognised as pioneer institute in Earth Sciences and Engineering.\n",
        "For a long period of time, IIT(ISM) has had a distinction and recognition of being the only educational institute in India which hosts all departments of earth sciences and engineering – Mining, Applied Geology, Applied Geophysics, Petroleum and Mineral Engineering. A glorious past marked with such distinction enables it to have an edge over other institutes of India when it comes to knowledge base and state-of-art facilities related to Earth Sciences and Engineering.\n",
        "With a background of IIT(ISM) Dhanbad, the centre CEEER aims to amalgamate the rich knowledge in the Earth Sciences and Engineering with the modern and recent concepts to deal with the new age challenges in the energy sector.\n",
        "The CEEER is aimed to find sustainable solutions for exploitation of available energy resources by developing environment-friendly energy production technologies. CEEER is envisioned to undertake research and development activities for energy extraction from subsurface resources, which include both conventional and unconventional resources, in the country in a balanced and sustainable manner with minimal environmental footprints, and in close cooperation with all stakeholders in the government and private sector.\n",
        "The centre is run by a multi-disciplinary team of scientists and engineers at IIT(ISM). It draws upon expertise from all geosciences discipline, including geology, geophysics, mining and mineralogy, and petroleum and environmental engineering, to conduct research and development studies in the specified areas of research. The team at CEEER is also supporting the energy industry (Mining and Oil & Gas industry) through advising and consulting.\n",
