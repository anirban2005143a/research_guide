              "'IIT ISM Dhanbad is actively involved in research related to tunnel construction, primarily through consultancy projects and sponsored research initiatives led by several faculty members. Key research activities and projects include:\\n\\n1. **Consultancy Project by Prof. Dheeraj Kumar**:  \\n   Prof. Dheeraj Kumar has completed a significant consultancy project involving the digitalization and monitoring of mine infrastructure, which includes the orientation and alignment of the Chenani–Nasri Road Tunnel. This tunnel, connecting Jammu and Srinagar, is one of the longest road tunnels in India and highlights the application of advanced monitoring and digitalization techniques in tunnel construction. The project involved a total of 77 industrial projects worth Rs. 3024 Lakhs, showcasing a strong integration of technology in real-world tunnel engineering.\\n\\n2. **Sponsored Research Projects by Prof. Swapnil Mishra**:  \\n   Prof. Swapnil Mishra has organized executive development programs (EDPs) for major industry stakeholders, specifically focusing on tunneling techniques. Notably, he led an EDP titled *“Design of Tunnels and Caverns for Hydro Power Projects”* (Project: Revised EDP/7106/2023-2024) in collaboration with NHPC from September 18–22, 2023. Additionally, he co-led another EDP on *“Specialised Course on NATM and TBM Tunnelling”* in November 2022, jointly conducted with the IIIF Delhi Center. These initiatives aim to upskill professionals in advanced tunneling methods, including New Austrian Tunnelling Method (NATM) and Tunnel Boring Machines (TBM), which are crucial in modern tunnel construction.\\n\\n3. **Academic Research by Prof. Rajib Sarkar**:  \\n   Prof. Rajib Sarkar has contributed to academic research on the seismic behavior of tunnels in discontinuous rock media. His work includes:\\n   - A 2016 conference paper titled *“Identification of critical parameters of seismic behaviour of tunnels in discontinuous medium”* presented at the Indian Geotechnical Conference in IIT Madras.\\n   - A 2017 paper *“Dynamic response of tunnel in blocky rock mass with EPS geofoam as seismic buffer”* presented at the Indian Geotechnical Conference in IIT Guwahati. This research focuses on mitigating seismic impacts using materials like EPS (Expanded Polystyrene) geofo'"

Key research activities and projects include:\\n\\n1. **Consultancy Project by Prof. Dheeraj Kumar**:  \\n   Prof. Dheeraj Kumar has completed a significant consultancy project involving the digitalization and monitoring of mine infrastructure, which includes the orientation and alignment of the Chenani–Nasri Road Tunnel. This tunnel, connecting Jammu and Srinagar, is one of the longest road tunnels in India and highlights the application of advanced monitoring and digitalization techniques in tunnel construction. The project involved a total of 77 industrial projects worth Rs. 3024 Lakhs, showcasing a strong integration of technology in real-world tunnel engineering.\\n\\n2. **Sponsored Research Projects by Prof. Swapnil Mishra**:  \\n   Prof. Swapnil Mishra has organized executive development programs (EDPs) for major industry stakeholders, specifically focusing on tunneling techniques. Notably, he led an EDP titled *“Design of Tunnels and Caverns for Hydro Power Projects”* (Project: Revised EDP/7106/2023-2024) in collaboration with NHPC from September 18–22, 2023. Additionally, he co-led another EDP on *“Specialised Course on NATM and TBM Tunnelling”* in November 2022, jointly conducted with the IIIF Delhi Center. These initiatives aim to upskill professionals in advanced tunneling methods, including New Austrian Tunnelling Method (NATM) and Tunnel Boring Machines (TBM), which are crucial in modern tunnel construction.\\n\\n3. **Academic Research by Prof. Rajib Sarkar**:  \\n   Prof. Rajib Sarkar has contributed to academic research on the seismic behavior of tunnels in discontinuous rock media. His work includes:\\n   - A 2016 conference paper titled *“Identification of critical parameters of seismic behaviour of tunnels in discontinuous medium”* presented at the Indian Geotechnical Conference in IIT Madras.\\n   - A 2017 paper *“Dynamic response of tunnel in blocky rock mass with EPS geofoam as seismic buffer”* presented at the Indian Geotechnical Conference in IIT Guwahati. This research focuses on mitigating seismic impacts using materials like EPS (Expanded Polystyrene) geofo', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 512, 'prompt_tokens': 1715, 'total_tokens': 2227}, 'model_name': 'Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None}, id='lc_run--019b6917-4bb9-7b93-8259-b4bfdf379c93-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1715, 'output_tokens': 512, 'total_tokens': 2227})]"
